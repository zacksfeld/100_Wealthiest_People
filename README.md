<h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<p>A dataset containing information about the 100 wealthiest individuals. I compared this dataset with relevant country's 
GDPs as well as information from wikipedia about the total number of billionaires within that country.</p>

<h3><b>Age distribution</b></h3>
<p>One of the useful pieces of information that can be gathered from the '100 Richest People' dataset is the distribution and prevelance of certain ages. The graph below illustrates the most common age range is between 50 and 70, with the largest age grouping being a tie between 60s and 70s.</p>

<h3><b>Looking At Country Data</b></h3>
<p>One interesting insight that is apparent almost immediately is how closely the total number of billionaires for a country mirrors the distribution of the 100 wealthiest people and what nationalities they identify as. Below is a graph showing the number of billionaires present in a country.</p>
