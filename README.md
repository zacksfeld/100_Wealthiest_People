<h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<p>A dataset containing information about the 100 wealthiest individuals. I compared this dataset with relevant country's 
GDPs as well as information from wikipedia about the total number of billionaires within that country.</p>

<h2><b>Age distribution</b></h2>
One of the useful pieces of information that can be gathered from the 'Top 100 Richest People' dataset is the distribution and prevelance of certain ages. The graph below illustrates the most common age range is between 50 and 70, with the largest age grouping being a tie between 60s and 70s.
